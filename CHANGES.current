Version 3.0.7 (in progress)
===========================

	    [Python] Docstrings provided via %feature("docstring") are now quoted and added to
            the tp_doc slot when using python builtin classes (-builtin). When no docstring is
            provided, the tp_doc slot is set to the fully qualified C/C++ class name.
            Github issues #445 and #461.

            [octave] Support Octave version 4.0.0 (thanks to patches from Orion Poplawski).

	    SWIG no longer generates a wrapper for a class' constructor if that class has
            any base class with a private destructor. This is because your compiler should
            not allow a class to be instantiated if a base has a private destructor. Some
            compilers do, so if you need the old behaviour, use the "notabstract" feature, eg:

              %feature("notabstract") Derived;
              class Base {
                ~Base() {}
              };
              struct Derived : Base {};
